I  actually attack the  concept of happiness.
I  don’t  mind  people  being  happy – but  the  idea  that  everything  we  do  is part  of  the  pursuit  of  happiness  seems  to  me  a  really dangerous idea. And has lead to a contemporary disease in western society which is fear of sadness.
It’s a really odd thing that we’re now seeing people saying “write down three things that make you happy today before you go to sleep” and  “cheer up” and  “happiness is our birth right”  and so on.
We’re kind of teaching our kids that happiness is the default position. It’s rubbish.
Wholeness  is  what  we  ought to be striving for and part of that is sadness, disappointment, frustration, failure, all of those things which make  us  who  we  are.
Happiness and victory and fulfilment are nice little things that also happen to us,  but  they  don’t  teach  us  much.
Everyone  says  that  we  grow  through  pain,  but  then  as  soon as  they  experience  pain,  they  say “Quick! Move on! Cheer up!”
I’d  like  just  for  a  year  to  have  a  moratorium  on  the  word  happiness,  and  to  replace  it  with  the word wholeness. Ask yourself “is this contributing to my wholeness?” And if you’re having a bad day, it is…
